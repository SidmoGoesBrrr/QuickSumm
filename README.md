# QuickSumm
Inspiration
We got our inspiration to build an audio and text summarizer from people who prefer to get the main points of an audio file or a podcast because some people preferring reading something rather than listening to it.

What it does
It converts an audio file or a piece of text to a summarized version of the contents of the input and returns the summary on a website.

How we built it
We used streamlit to design the web interface, while the spacy and heapq modules helped with summarizing the input. Most importantly, we used AssemblyAI to convert the audio into text and summarize the audio.

Challenges we ran into
Each team member had a skill, and we combined all those skills to form this project. The only thing we really faced a challenge in was the AssemblyAi part because we had to figure out how to use it.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our idea because as mentioned, we managed to get an idea that would combine all the skills we had into one project. We are also extremely proud of how efficiently each of us contributed our part to this project.

What we learned
We learned that the AssemblyAI is another tool that we can use for future projects. We also learned that even though you may think that you do not have enough time, you can still accomplish what you need to if you put your mind to it.

What's next for QuickSumm
We will now work on translating audio and text from different languages into English, summarizing that and then returning the summarized text in the original language.
